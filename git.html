<h1>A student’s guide to git<a class="headerlink" href="#a-student-s-guide-to-git" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Making worthy software involves collaborating with others as a team. With such
collaboration comes the complexity of managing who is working on what and when
and how are they doing it. Changes happen to the system all the time. Maybe two
of them tried to change the same parts .. and what happens then?</p>
<p>The role of a “source code management system” or “source control system” is to
help coordinate these changes as a project progresses, and beyond release and
during maintenance too … as software is never truly “done”.</p>
<p>There is another collaborator who is often ignore and that is oneself. Even
if a piece of software is being worked on by a solo developer, that developer
also undergoes change as understanding of the problem being worked on changes
over time and as new learning is acquired. So a programmer has to collaborate
with their future selves.</p>
<p>Today, “git” is the most widely used source control system and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com">github.com</a>
is the most widely used online “collaboration as a service”. In this chapter,
you’ll be introduced to some of the mechanisms of git so you understand
what’s going on to some extent and are also able to use it.</p>
<div class="admonition-getting-help admonition">
<p class="admonition-title"><strong>Getting help</strong></p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span></code> command line tool comes with built-in help on every command.
Just typing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">help</span></code> will bring up a list of supported “sub commands”.
For any specific sub-command, you can type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">help</span> <span class="pre">&lt;subcommand&gt;</span></code> to get
more detailed help. You can also do <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">&lt;subcommand&gt;</span> <span class="pre">--help</span></code> to get the
same help.</p>

<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>Sign up for an account on <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com">github.com</a>. You’ll have to choose a short name
to refer to your account which is usually called your “github handle”. Your
“GitHub profile” (often used as a resumé these days) can be found at
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com">https://github.com</a>/{yourhandle}. For example, mine is at
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/srikumarks">https://github.com/srikumarks</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Have one of your team members create a “repository” which will contain your
project’s materials – source code, documentation, tests, examples, etc.
Let’s say the repository is called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">project350</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>If you’ve made your project public, then anyone will be able to “clone” your
repository on their computers. “Cloning” refers to fetching the entire project
along with its whole history into a local copy in order to peruse it or
contribute to it. The command for clone is –</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git<span class="w"> </span>clone<span class="w"> </span>&lt;repo-url&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>I recommend you use the “ssh clone” URL so that you don’t have to keep
typing in your account password every time you want to contribute changes.
See <a class="reference internal" href="#ssh-key-setup"><span class="std std-ref">Using ssh keys with github.com</span></a> to set this up.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com">github.com</a>, go to your <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">project350</span></code> repository settings and invite
your team-mates as “collaborators”. You can given them “developer” rights,
which means your team-mates will be able to contribute to the repository.</p></li>
<li><p>When you clone the repository (“repo” for short), you also get a copy of the
latest version of the files in the repo. This is usually called “a checkout”.
It’s a bit anachronistic term today, but it’s stuck with us.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span></code> would’ve checked out what’s called the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">main</span></code> “branch” of the repo.</p></li>
</ol>

<section id="first-steps">
<h2>First steps<a class="headerlink" href="#first-steps" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once you’ve cloned <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">project350</span></code>, you’ll have a local folder with that same
name. Using the shell <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cd</span></code> command, change the present working directory to
that folder. That will be  –</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">cd</span><span class="w"> </span>project350
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Create a new file named <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">README.md</span></code> (a convention on <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com">github.com</a>) for
repositories. This is a “Markdown” file that is expected to contain a
description of your project and anything you think someone interested in your
project might want to know about the project.</p>
<p>First off, you’ll be making changes to the repo and your team-mates will need
to know who made what change. So you’ll need to tell git who you are. You do
that using –</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git<span class="w"> </span>config<span class="w"> </span>user.name<span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;C. V. Raman&quot;</span>
git<span class="w"> </span>config<span class="w"> </span>user.email<span class="w"> </span>cvraman@krea.edu.in
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Once you do that, git will remember this for your repository and note down your
name and email whenever you make a change to the repository.</p>
<p>Open <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">README.md</span></code> in a text editor such as VSCode and type in some description
and save it. Now do –</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git<span class="w"> </span>add<span class="w"> </span>README.md
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This marks the changes in the file as “to be put into the repository” (a place
called the git “index”) but it’s not yet in the repository. Now do –</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git<span class="w"> </span>commit<span class="w"> </span>-m<span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;Initial commit of README&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This will collect everything “added” so far and pack up those changes into a
bundle called a “commit”. This commit will be linked to the currently checked
out “latest version” and then placed into your local clone of the repository.</p>
<p>At this stage, only you can see the changes you’ve made. It is not yet visible to
your team-mates. So you now need to “push” these changes to the repository copy
on <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com">github.com</a> using –</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git<span class="w"> </span>push
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Follow any instructions that the command might ask you to do when you push for
the first time.</p>
<div class="admonition-all-history-is-intact admonition">
<p class="admonition-title"><strong>All history is intact</strong></p>
<p>When you edit any number of files and add them using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">add</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span>
<span class="pre">commit</span></code> the set of changes to your repository, nothing gets overwritten or
lost. THe whole purpose of git is to never lose history (though there are
commands to modify history which you should <strong>NEVER</strong> use). What git stores
is simply the set of <em>changes</em> you made and you can think of a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">checkout</span></code>
instruction as “start at the the beginning where my repository was empty and
apply all the changes I made one by one till you come to the latest version”.
Git works more efficiently than that, but in effect it is doing just that.
You can see the sequence of changes using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">log</span></code>.</p>
</div>
<figure class="align-center" id="id4">

<p><span class="caption-number">Fig. 2 </span><span class="caption-text">This figure shows the beginnings of a repository with two branches in progress.</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id4" title="Permalink to this image">¶</a></p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the figure above, note that the two branches share a couple of change sets,
although the view from each branch is as though it has a single linear history
traceable all the way to the “start”.</p>
<p>The arrows from each “change set” or “commit” point to the “parent commit”,
which then points to its “parent”, all the way back to the start. When you add
a new commit, you’re in effect doing the following –</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Add another block, say, “change set 5” that points its parent to the “work-in-progress”
branch (if that’s the currently checked out branch).</p></li>
<li><p>Move the label “work-in-progress” from “change set 4” to “change set 5” so that
checking out “work-in-progress” will from now on reconstruct the state of the
repository as it exists on your local folder right now.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>To check whether you have any “uncommitted” changes in your local repo copy
(a.k.a. “clone”), you can do –</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">git</span> <span class="n">status</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>That command will show the current branch you’re on as well as list any changed
files that aren’t yet committed to the repository. If there are no changes, you
can switch to another branch simply using –</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git<span class="w"> </span>checkout<span class="w"> </span>&lt;branchname&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Although it will initially look as though some of the changes you’d done have
been lost, rest assured that they’re all stored just fine and you can switch
back using –</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git<span class="w"> </span>checkout<span class="w"> </span>&lt;previous-branchname&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>… to get those back.</p>
<div class="admonition-all-history-is-intact admonition">
<p class="admonition-title"><strong>All history is intact</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I’m saying it again just so you can internalize it. Any changes
checked into your git repository won’t get “lost”. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#fossil" id="id1" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>1<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>

<p>There is another git-like version system called “fossil” that does
this better than git, but it is more advanced and with less widespread
support.</p>

</section>
<section id="simple-workflow">
<h2>Simple workflow<a class="headerlink" href="#simple-workflow" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you’re working on a series of changes towards a “feature” in your program,
you should create a new branch for it using –</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git<span class="w"> </span>branch<span class="w"> </span>&lt;new_branch_name&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Let’s say the new branch name was <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">awesome_feature</span></code>. To switch the “current
branch” to the newly created branch (which is merely a label referring to the
same “latest change set” you had earlier), you can do –</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">git</span> <span class="n">switch</span> <span class="n">awesome_feature</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now you work on your changes and commit relatively small but meaningful
changesets as you work towards completing your feature. Ensure that you supply
adequate descriptions of your change sets when you do a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">commit</span></code> so that
you can later recall what a particular set of changes was about.</p>
<p>The “done” point of a feature branch is an agreement with your team-mates,
but it usually involves the following –</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>You’ve run the code and checked that it works.</p></li>
<li><p>The new code you’ve written has tests to show that they work and can be run
to ensure that changes others make to the codebase don’t break your code.</p></li>
<li><p>The code is understandable, cleaned up and documented for others to be
able to read.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Once you’re done, you can “merge” your changes to the “main” branch like this –</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Ensure all changes are committed to the repository and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">status</span></code>
shows no pending changes.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">checkout</span> <span class="pre">main</span></code> - switch to the main branch.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">merge</span> <span class="pre">awesome_feature</span></code> – this is a kind of “magic step that will
apply all the changes you did on the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">awesome_feature</span></code> branch and apply
it on top of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">main</span></code> branch. Now, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">main</span></code> branch will also
contain the changes implementing your new feature.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">push</span></code> – to send it over to github’s copy of the repository so
that others can get to see it.</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="admonition-merge-conflicts admonition">
<p class="admonition-title"><strong>Merge conflicts</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes, when you merge a branch to another, you may end up with what are
called “conflicts”. This is when changesets in the two branches are giving
git instructions to edit the same parts of a file in different ways and it
can’t decide what to do. In such cases, it’ll mark your files with change
annotation and put itself in a “conflict” state awaiting your resolution.
You then proceed to edit the conflicting files, resolving the conflicts,
and then commit the changes to complete the merge. We’ll deal with merge
conflicts when you run into them.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="tagging">
<h2>Tagging<a class="headerlink" href="#tagging" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>You can mark a particular change-set with a label, called a “tag”, so that you
can remember to pick that version of the code for some reference purpose such
as for reporting a bug or fixing a bug.</p>
<p>You’ve already seen one kind of tag – we called them “branches”. The only
difference between a “branch” and a “tag” is that a “tag” stays associated with
the change-set forever whereas the association between a branch label and a
change-set will get updated every time you make a new commit to the branch. In
other words, the branch label will get re-associated with the new change-set
you committed to the branch.</p>
<p>You could say a “tag” is an immutable “constant” and a branch is a “variable”.</p>
<p>Tags are typically used to mark “gold versions” for deployment and are often
associated with appropriate “release notes”. Typical tag names are like
version numbers – “v1.0.5”, “v2.1.0-alpha” and so on.</p>
</section>
<section id="debugging">
<h2>Debugging<a class="headerlink" href="#debugging" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once of the nice things about having a series of granular change sets is that
when you suddenly realize that there is a bug in your program that didn’t exist
before, you can track down the specific change when it happened rather easily.</p>
<p>Assuming <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tag1</span></code> refers to a version of the program that didn’t have the buggy
behaviour you noticed and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tag2</span></code> refers to the version where the bug
manifests, you can test for the bug somewhere half way between the two tags in
the linear chain between them. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#nonlinear" id="id2" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>2<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> If the bug is absent, then perhaps
it was introduced only after that “half way point”. If the bug is present, then
you have to search the first half of the series of change sets only. You’ve
eliminated half of the candidate change sets! This way, you can “bisect” and
track down the specific set of changes that introduced the bug.</p>
<aside class="footnote brackets" id="nonlinear" role="note">
<span class="label"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span><a role="doc-backlink" href="#id2">2</a><span class="fn-bracket">]</span></span>
<p>It’s more complicated if the two tags are not part of the
same branch.</p>

<h2><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">gui</span></code><a class="headerlink" href="#git-gui" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Git comes with its own desktop GUI tool for managing commits. Depending on
your system, you may already have it installed and if not you may have to
install the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git-gui</span></code> package.</p>
<p>To launch the GUI, just do –</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git<span class="w"> </span>gui
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The interface helps navigate the history of changes and the various branches,
etc. However the most useful part of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git-gui</span></code> is to let you select a subset
of changes made in order to form a commit. This task is better done visually
than purely on the command line, though it is also possible to do it on the
command line. Due to the human judgement involved in this step, there is little
you can do to automate it anyway.</p>

<p>To simplify the process of development so you don’t have to type in your
username and token every time you need to push some commits to your repository,
set an “ssh key” for accessing github using the following steps. The original
documentation is at the following two locations –</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent">Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent</a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account">Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account</a></p></li>
</ol>
<p>You can follow those two links which have specific instructions for each
platform. Since we’re standardized on unix systems (including WSL), here is an
extract of the steps. The lines that start with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$</span></code> are commands that you
should copy and paste into the shell (without the start <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$</span></code> character, which
is there as a placeholder for the prompt).</p>
<p>Generate a new “key-pair”</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C &quot;your_email@example.com&quot;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You’ll be asked for a file name like this –</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">Enter</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">file</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">which</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">save</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">key</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">Users</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">YOU</span><span class="o">/.</span><span class="n">ssh</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">id_ed25519</span><span class="p">):</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">Press</span> <span class="n">enter</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If that file doesn’t exist already, you can press enter to continue. Otherwise
type in a file name to which to write the key - such as
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/Users/YOU/.ssh/github_key</span></code> Once you go through with that, two files will be
created – a) <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">github_key</span></code> and b) <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">github_key.pub</span></code>. The former is the
“private key” that you shouldn’t share and the latter is the public key
intended for sharing.</p>
<p>If you do <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ls</span> <span class="pre">-l</span> <span class="pre">/Users/YOU/.ssh</span></code>, you may notice that the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">github_key</span></code>
file has fewer permissions (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-rw-------</span></code>) than the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">github_key.pub</span></code> file
(<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-rw-r--r--</span></code>). That is as it should be.</p>
<p>You’ll be prompted to enter a “passphrase”. For our purposes it is overkill and
the simplicity of not having a passphrase is helpful. So just press ENTER when
prompted like shown below -</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">Enter</span> <span class="n">passphrase</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">empty</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">no</span> <span class="n">passphrase</span><span class="p">):</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">Type</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">passphrase</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">Enter</span> <span class="n">same</span> <span class="n">passphrase</span> <span class="n">again</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">Type</span> <span class="n">passphrase</span> <span class="n">again</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Then start the “ssh agent” in the background like this <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#sshagent" id="id3" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>3<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> -</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ eval &quot;$(ssh-agent -s)&quot;
</pre></div>
</div>
<aside class="footnote brackets" id="sshagent" role="note">
<span class="label"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span><a role="doc-backlink" href="#id3">3</a><span class="fn-bracket">]</span></span>
<p>You may need to use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sudo</span></code> command to run the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ssh-sgent</span></code>. See the similar portion of <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent">Generating a new SSH key and
adding it to the ssh-agent</a> if have any permission issues running the above
command (search that page for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ssh-agent</span></code> to find this spot).</p>
</aside>
<p>Now you need to tell the ssh agent the key you want to use when accessing github
so it can use it automatically. You do this by creating/editing the file
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">~/.ssh/config</span></code>. Here <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">~</span></code> refers to your “home directory” – the place that
the shell takes you when you run <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cd</span></code> without any arguments. Often, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">echo</span> <span class="pre">$HOME</span></code>
will also reveal your home directory. Create the “.ssh” directory in case it doesn’t
exist already and then create the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">config</span></code> file with the following contents.</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">Host</span> <span class="n">github</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">com</span>
    <span class="n">AddKeysToAgent</span> <span class="n">yes</span>
    <span class="n">IdentityFile</span> <span class="o">~/.</span><span class="n">ssh</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">github_key</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Add the key to the ssh agent.</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/github_key
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now you need to add the key to your github account. To do this, first print
the public key like this –</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ cat ~/.ssh/github_key.pub
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You should see something like below -</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">ssh</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">ed25519</span> <span class="n">AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAICel5</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="n">FQUyquxyTJJjQzt5lSLaEKRaXTKPr1QbceunB</span> <span class="s2">&quot;your_email@example.com&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Copy whatever was printed by the cat command to the clipboard. On MacOS, you
can do that using the following command using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pbcopy</span></code> where “pb” stands for
“pasteboard” a.k.a. “clipboard” -</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>cat<span class="w"> </span>~/.ssh/github_key.pub<span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span>pbcopy
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now you need to tell github about your public key so that it can ratify
messages you send as being genuinely from you. (The below steps are from
github’s docs … more or less)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In the upper-right corner of any page on GitHub, click your profile photo,
then click Settings.</p></li>
<li><p>In the “Access” section of the sidebar, click  “SSH and GPG keys”.</p></li>
<li><p>Click New SSH key or Add SSH key.</p></li>
<li><p>In the “Title” field, add a descriptive label for the new key. For example,
if you’re using a personal laptop, you might call this key “Personal laptop”.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the type of key as “authentication key”. Signing keys are useful for
larger scale collaborative projects where collaborators may be asked to sign
their commits. (The Linux Kernel project uses this, for example).</p></li>
<li><p>In the “Key” field, paste your public key. This is the contents of the “.pub”
file that you copied to the clipboard above.</p></li>
<li><p>Click “Add SSH key”.</p></li>
<li><p>If prompted, confirm access to your account on GitHub. For more information,
see <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/sudo-mode">Sudo mode</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The end result</strong> of all of this is that when you clone your private
repositories or try to push changes to them and you have your email configured
in the repository correctly, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span></code> command like tool will not prompt you
again for username/password/token and you can finally get into flow.</p>
<p>Also, the clone URL for cloning using SSH will look different compared to a
normal <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">https://</span></code> URL. It’ll look like this –
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git&#64;github.com:{handle}/{reponame}.git</span></code> – and you clone it the same way like this –</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">git</span> <span class="n">clone</span> <span class="n">git</span><span class="nd">@github</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">com</span><span class="p">:{</span><span class="n">handle</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="n">reponame</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">git</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>… which will create a directory named <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">{reponame}</span></code> in the working directory
where you ran the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">clone</span></code> command.</p>

<h3>For the curious<a class="headerlink" href="#for-the-curious" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you’re wondering what this whole “private key”, “public key” and “ssh” dance
was all about, we just established a way for us to send a message to github to
do some operations to our private repositories in a manner that github can
verify that indeed those instructions did come from us and not from someone
else. <strong>Only</strong> you can produce a “signature” (for a message you send to github)
using your “private key”, which nobody else has. But <strong>any party</strong> who has your
“public key” (such as github) can verify that indeed the given signature was
produced by someone who possessed the corresponding private key.</p>
<p>You can sign and verify an arbitrary piece of text like this –</p>
<p>Make a message and store it in a file.</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ echo &quot;My message: hello world!&quot; &gt; /tmp/txt
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Sign the above message and store the signature in /tmp/sig</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ cat /tmp/txt | ssh-keygen -Y sign -n file -f /Users/YOU/.ssh/github_key &gt; /tmp/sig

$ cat /tmp/sig
# You&#39;ll see some random numbers and letters. This is the &quot;signature&quot;.
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Note who can sign</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ echo &quot;your_email@example.com $(cat /Users/YOU/.ssh/github_key.pub)&quot; &gt; /tmp/allowed-signers
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Verify that the signature is indeed that of the signer. Note that this step
does not make use of the “private key” and only requires the “public key”</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ echo /tmp/txt | ssh-keygen -Y verify -f /tmp/allowed-signers -I your_email@example.com -n file -s /tmp/sig
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The two “keys” are mathematically related to each other in hard-to-reproduce
ways and are therefore referred to as “key pairs” in most documentation.</p>
<p>You may study the innards of this mechanism if you take a cryptography course.</p>
