<h1>The “shell”<a class="headerlink" href="#the-shell" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>The <strong>shell</strong> (a.k.a. the “command line”) has been given that name in line with
the notion of the operating system <strong>kernel</strong> which serves as its core. The
shell then offers a means of interacting with the kernel to use its services,
such as managing the <strong>file system</strong>.</p>
<p>For this course, I urge you to become familiar with doing much, if not all, of
your activities via the shell on your laptop. If you’re using MacOS, the
“Terminal” application offers such a shell. If you’re using Windows, please
install “WSL” (“Windows Subsystem for Linux” with Ubuntu as the OS choice) and
use that in place of the traditional Windows “command line”.</p>
<p>This document offers a “cheat sheet” that you can refer to for common
operations you need to perform. I’ll assume that you’re familiar with basic
computer organization terms such as “file” and “folder” (a.k.a. “directory”).</p>
<section id="basics-and-guidelines">
<h2>Basics and Guidelines<a class="headerlink" href="#basics-and-guidelines" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are 3 main concepts you need to be familiar with to use the shell
effectively.</p>
<section id="running-a-command">
<h3>Running a command<a class="headerlink" href="#running-a-command" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>A “command” is (typically) a verb instruction given to the shell that identifies
an operation to perform and takes arguments that control that operation. A command
has the simple form of verb and arguments separated by one or more spaces. The number
of space characters separating arguments does not matter. Here are some such commands.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ls</span> <span class="pre">-l</span> <span class="pre">mydir</span></code> - lists the contents of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mydir</span></code> directory in “long form”.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cd</span> <span class="pre">mydir</span></code> - changes the present working directory to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mydir</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cat</span> <span class="pre">textfile.txt</span></code> - dumps <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">textfile.txt</span></code> to the terminal.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All shell commands send their output to a stream called “standard output” (or
“stdout” for short) and perhaps another (depending on the case) called
“standard error” (or “stderr” for short). The shell programs also take input
from a “standard input” (or “stdin” for short). So the general structure of a
command invocation is –</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">verb</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="ow">or</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">command</span> <span class="n">arg1</span> <span class="n">arg2</span> <span class="o">...</span> <span class="n">argN</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Most shells (such as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bash</span></code> on Ubuntu and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">zsh</span></code> on MacOS), will interpret
some characters in the arguments as special. For example, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ls</span> <span class="pre">prefix*</span></code> will
list all the files that start with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">prefix</span></code>, taking the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">*</span></code> to match
anything that follows the prefix string. So what do you do if your file name
itself has one of these characters? In such cases, you can strict quote the
file name using single quotes, like this – <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ls</span> <span class="pre">'prefix*'</span></code>. Similar to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">*</span></code>,
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">?</span></code> character will match any single character, so <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ls</span> <span class="pre">'*.??'</span></code> will list
all files that have two character “extensions” (the portion after the “.”).</p>
<div class="admonition-note admonition">
<p class="admonition-title"><strong>Note</strong></p>
<p>The special characters <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">*</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">?</span></code> are called “wild card” characters
because, as in the UNO game, they can be used in place of arbitrary text.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition-another-note admonition">
<p class="admonition-title"><strong>Another note</strong></p>
<p>If you have two files named <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">assignment-first.txt</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">assignment-second.txt</span></code> in the current directory and you’ve typed <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ls</span>
<span class="pre">assignment-*</span></code> expecting to see both of them, know that doing so is exactly
equivalent to having typed <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ls</span> <span class="pre">assignment-first.txt</span> <span class="pre">assignment-second.txt</span></code>
by hand! i.e. The wild card characters are expanded first and passed as
arguments to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ls</span></code> program <em>before</em> running the program.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="redirecting-the-output-of-a-command">
<h3>Redirecting the output of a command<a class="headerlink" href="#redirecting-the-output-of-a-command" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>We saw that commands send their output to their <em>stdout</em>. If we want to store
whatever is sent to the command’s <em>stdout</em> to a file for later use, we can use
the “redirection” operator <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&gt;</span></code> like this – <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">command</span> <span class="pre">arg1</span> <span class="pre">arg2</span> <span class="pre">...</span> <span class="pre">argN</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span>
<span class="pre">filename.ext</span></code>. Note that the file name and extension are completely arbitrary
from the system’s perspective. Different programs may interpret extensions
according to their own conventions. It is common for text files to have the
“.txt” extension and programming language source code files are also identified
by their extension by editors.</p>
<p>For example, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ls</span> <span class="pre">-l</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">/tmp/listing.txt</span></code> will list the files in the current
directory in long form and store (“redirect”) that output to the file at the
absolute path <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/tmp/listing.txt</span></code>. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/tmp</span></code> folder, by convention, is
commonly used for temporary files and this directory is emptied every time you
reboot your machine.</p>
<div class="admonition-note admonition">
<p class="admonition-title"><strong>Note</strong></p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&gt;</span></code> redirection operator will only redirect <em>stdout</em> and not <em>stderr</em>.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="connecting-programs-via-pipes">
<h3>Connecting programs via pipes<a class="headerlink" href="#connecting-programs-via-pipes" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Since shell programs take their input from a <em>stdin</em> and output their results
to an <em>stdout</em>, we can now think about combining programs by connecting the
<em>stdout</em> of one command/program to the <em>stdin</em> of another command/program to
further process the output of the first program.</p>
<p>This is called “piping” and is done using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">|</span></code> operator.</p>
<p>Shell programs in unix operating systems are designed to do one focused task
each that work usually by taking input from <em>stdin</em> and sending output to
<em>stdout</em>. So accomplishing more complex tasks that involve more than one such
operation is usually done via piping, or if piping is not feasible for some
reason, via temporary files on the file system.</p>
<p>Typically, programs work with lines of text one line at a time as well. This
means if you organize the output of a program as lines of text, you can
bring many tools to bear on that representation right within the shell.</p>
<p>The piping syntax is simple –</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&lt;command1&gt;<span class="w"> </span>&lt;argA1&gt;<span class="w"> </span>&lt;argA2&gt;<span class="w"> </span>..<span class="w"> </span>&lt;argAM&gt;<span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span>&lt;command2&gt;<span class="w"> </span>&lt;argB1&gt;<span class="w"> </span>&lt;argB2&gt;<span class="w"> </span>...<span class="w"> </span>&lt;argBN&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>For example, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ls</span> <span class="pre">-l</span> <span class="pre">|</span> <span class="pre">grep</span> <span class="pre">'[.]js$'</span></code> will take the long form listing of the
current directory and pass that list to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">grep</span> <span class="pre">'[.]js$'</span></code> which will read each
line in its input and only send to its <em>stdout</em> only those lines that have ‘.js’
as the last two characters on the line.</p>
<p>Notice how <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ls</span></code> itself doesn’t need to do any such filtering and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">grep</span></code>
doesn’t need to know anything about line-by-line listing of filenames and yet
we can put these together to “list only the javascript source files in the
current directory”, for that is the meaning we attach to files with names that
have “.js” as their extensions.</p>
<p>Obviously, you can repeat such a pipe operation like – <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cmd1</span> <span class="pre">|</span> <span class="pre">cmd2</span> <span class="pre">|</span> <span class="pre">cmd3</span> <span class="pre">...</span></code>
and the combination will do the obvious thing.</p>
<div class="admonition-note admonition">
<p class="admonition-title"><strong>Note</strong></p>
<p>If the commands are all producing their outputs one line at a time and
consuming one line of input at a time, then if any of the commands deep down
the “pipeline” fails at a point, the whole pipeline will fail without
forcing the first command to run to completion. i.e. The whole pipe will
fail early, and this is an incredibly useful property. This also means that
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cmd2</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cmd3</span></code> etc. will start their processing even before <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cmd1</span></code> has
completed generating all its output. This magic is orchestrated by the
kernel facility called “process”.</p>

<section id="useful-conventions-of-shell-programs">
<h2>Useful conventions of shell programs<a class="headerlink" href="#useful-conventions-of-shell-programs" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>You’d have seen argument of the form <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-l</span></code> that kind of stand out from other
“normal” arguments like file names. These are called “flags” or “switches” and
give special instruction to the command. In the case of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ls</span></code>, adding a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-l</span></code>
flag tells it to output lots of details about the files in the specified
directory (or the current directory).</p>
<p>Some commands also have long descriptive flags that make such commands more
readable and easier to debug. One such common conventional flag is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--help</span></code>.
These long flags always start with two hyphen characters and may take an
additional associated value (depending on the situation) like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--flag=value</span></code>
or equivalently <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--flag</span> <span class="pre">value</span></code>.</p>
<section id="help">
<h3><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--help</span></code><a class="headerlink" href="#help" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you want some quick details of what a command does, you can often invoke it
with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--help</span></code> flag to get a short help. Sometimes, the short flag <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-h</span></code>
also works but <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--help</span></code> is more common.</p>
</section>
<section id="man">
<h3><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">man</span></code><a class="headerlink" href="#man" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>To get detailed help about a program’s function, you can consult its “manual
pages” using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">man</span></code> command. For example, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">man</span> <span class="pre">ls</span></code> will bring up the
manual page for the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ls</span></code> command giving details of all its parameters and
what they are for.</p>
<div class="admonition-note admonition">
<p class="admonition-title"><strong>Note</strong></p>
<p>You are NOT expected to know by heart what the flags of various commands are
and what they do. You can always look them up using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">man</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;cmd&gt;</span>
<span class="pre">--help</span></code> when you need to. <strong>In fact, you should expect to do a LOT more
reading of manuals than writing of code!!</strong>, at least in the early stages of
mastery.</p>

<section id="google">
<h3>Google<a class="headerlink" href="#google" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Of course, all such help is available via Google, so you can always google for
help. In fact, all the man pages are also available on the internet and if you
type “man &lt;something&gt;” in google, you’ll be taken to the appropriate linux man
pages (usually, if you’re lucky, these days).</p>
<p>The caveat is that there are many predatory sites that have “SEO”d their way to
the top of the google search list for such programmer help and which more often
are interested in engaging you on their site for advertisement revenue than
actually helping you with what you want. For this reason, once you find out about
a command using Google, I recommend you stick to referring to its <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">man</span></code> page
for the details.</p>

<p>For <strong>all</strong> details on <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>Javascript</strong> functions and
objects related details, use the “Mozilla Developer Network” or “MDN” for
short. These are excellent, descriptive and non predatory pages that give you
precise definitions with examples to help understand how to use a particular
feature. In other words, “MDN” is your <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">man</span></code> for those three areas.</p>
<p>To search MDN specifically, you can always add the word “mdn” to any search you
do in google that pertains to those topics and an MDN page will usually be the
first link you get. For example, to learn how to specify argument of

<p class="admonition-title"><em>History note</em></p>
<p>Why is this program called “less” you ask? The original unix pager program
was called “more”, which would show a page of content and wait for you to
hit the space bar to show the next page (hence “pager”). When GNU/Linux was
written, they couldn’t use the same program name for copyright reasons, so
they named it “less” because “less is more” :P Unix history is full of such
delightful/groanful word play.</p>
</div>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">curl</span> <span class="pre">URL</span></code> – Downloads the given URL and sends the result to its <em>stdout</em>.
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">curl</span></code> is a very powerful program with very many options to control the kind
of request sent, kind of data and headers to send, etc. It’s all documented in
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">man</span> <span class="pre">curl</span></code>.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">touch</span> <span class="pre">FILENAME</span></code> – does not modify the file at all, except for changing its
“last update time stamp” to the current time. If the file with that name doesn’t
exist, it creates an empty file with that name.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vi</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vim</span></code> – is an interactive text editor that can be found
pre-installed on all Linux systems. So it is useful to be familiar with some
basics. Firstly, always use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vim</span></code> instead of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vi</span></code> ‘cos its “improved vi”.
This editor has two “modes” – the “insert mode” where you type into the text
file, and the “command mode” where you can issue edit commands. At launch,
you’ll be put in the “command mode”. You can enter the “insert mode” by
pressing the “i” key. Then type away like in a normal editor. When you’re ready
to save and quit, switch to the command mode by pressing the ESC key. Then to
write the text to a file, type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">:w</span> <span class="pre">FILENAME&lt;enter&gt;</span></code>. To quit, you type
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">:q</span></code>. This much should help you not be puzzled when you’re on the occasion
thrown into the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vim</span></code> editor. These commands are the same for both <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vi</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vim</span></code>.</p>
<p>(MacOS only) <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pbcopy</span></code> – takes all the input given to its <em>stdin</em> and copies
it to the clipboard so you can paste it anywhere you want using Cmd-P. So, for
example, you can copy a list of files in the current directory using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ls</span> <span class="pre">|</span> <span class="pre">pbcopy</span></code>.</p>
<p>(MacOS only) <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pbpaste</span></code> – copies the contents of the clipboard to its
<em>stdout</em> so you can further process it by piping it to other programs.</p>
