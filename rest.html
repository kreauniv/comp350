<h1>Representational State Transfer (REST)<a class="headerlink" href="#representational-state-transfer-rest" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>About a couple of decades ago, an application or software product (online or
offline) was generally conceived of and delivered in isolation, as an entity in
its own right. We had text editors, internet search, Photoshop, Pro Tools, MS
Word, MS Excel, MS Powerpoint, all could be thought of by the end user as
existing in independent silos, with some bit of exchange facilitated by the
operating system via the file system or the “clipboard”.</p>
<p>In the past decade or so, applications and products are no longer thought of in
isolation. The attention to interoperability led to the rise of “software as a
service” or SaaS platforms. Software such as payment systems may not
necessarily be user facing for the core business, but might exist to facilitate
payment for other businesses. Data storage systems such as Amazon’s S3 exist
not to serve the storage needs of end users, but as an online storage service
that enterprises and other applications can be designed with. Even Google
spreadsheets, which looks like it might still fit the old school definition of
an “application”, provides APIs that let other applications use a google sheet
as a database of sorts, with their own applications such as Google forms
building on top of it.</p>
<p>In a way, this “new thing” is not really new – as happens in the computing
world all the time. The much older unix “command line programs” may look like
they were designed in isolation, but they were actually designed to co-exist
well in an ecosystem of tools via the common protocol of “piping” and the
“standard I/O” streams that all applications were given by the OS. Any application
that produced and consumed text via its standard I/O could delegate certain
kinds of processing to the existence of other tools in the ecosystem. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ls</span></code>
does not need to implement what <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sort</span></code> does as long as its output fit what
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sort</span></code> could handle.</p>
<p>Another such mechanism was “Apple Events” on MacOS … which actually is very
closely related to REST which we’ll discuss in this section. Mac applications
can publish “vocabularies” that might send/receive and process events by other
applications. Although these messages are called “events”, they almost always
take the form of some representation of an internal thing owned by an
application that is shuttled to and fro other applications, which is the
essence of REST.</p>
<p>Today, applications can no longer be created in ignorance of the internet and
we have a flexible communication mechanism and protocol in TCP/IP with HTTP
layered on top of it, enabling applications to talk to each other in the common
language of “resources” and their “representations”.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>You might also hear the term “API” used to refer to these interfaces.
“API” stands for “Application Programming Interface” and can be used broadly
for any part of a software system that wishes to expose some functionality
to another part via some set of mechanisms and contracts. We therefore
can talk of “C APIs”, “C++ class APIs”, “Windows APIs”, “MacOS APIs”,
in addition to “PayPal API”, “Google sheet API” etc. Hence it is a broader
term, though heavily used today in the context of internet applications
to refer to “REST APIs”.</p>

<section id="preliminaries">
<h2>Preliminaries<a class="headerlink" href="#preliminaries" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Before we dive into an example API, it is important to understand the
consequences of some of the design choices of the internet that affect these
systems.</p>
<p>What we call the “internet” today is a set of physical wired and wireless
connections between machines, and a set of algorithms that help route
information from any machine to any other machine that can be reached either
directly or indirectly. This “internet core” does not distinguish between
“server” and “client”. Every machine that is connected to some other machine is
assigned an “IP address” that’s different from that machine so the two can
address each other and send messages.</p>
<div class="admonition-rabbit-hole-there admonition">
<p class="admonition-title"><strong>Rabbit hole there</strong></p>
<p>There is far more to be talked about regarding the structure and function
of the internet as a network than we can afford here. So I’ll leave it
at that and we’ll learn the bits of importance to us as we go along.</p>
</div>
<p>Since it is hard to remember lots of numbers so we can type them into the
browser, the internet architecture also includes “Domain Name Service”
(abbreviated DNS). These DNS servers help map names to specific IP addresses.
So when you type</p>

<h2>A case - AWS S3<a class="headerlink" href="#a-case-aws-s3" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Rather than give a dry definition of REST and work from there, let’s first look
at an example - Amazon’s “Simple Storage Service”, referred to as “S3” in short.</p>
<div class="admonition-do-now admonition">
<p class="admonition-title"><strong>Do now</strong></p>
<p>Visit the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/Type_API_Reference.html">AWS S3 API reference</a> and browse around for a bit.
Do you understand what it does? You can also checkout the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide//Welcome.html">S3 user guide</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>Maybe it should no longer be called “<strong>Simple</strong> Storage Service”, but it is not
surprising that the documentation around it is overwhelming. It might even come
as a surprise to you to know that at the core, the AWS S3 service is about
storing chunks of bytes (which it calls “objects”) at specified “addresses” in
specified “buckets”. These “objects” are what we might think of as “files” on
our computer, except that S3 can, if you need it, provide Petabytes of storage
on demand.</p>
