Introduction
============

This is a course for 3rd year computer science undergraduate students that
takes them through a complete software project from concept to execution,
dealing with the necessary processed and tools along the way.

This documentation site (largely) collects reference material for the students
to use during the course.

While there is a fair focus on coding, it is not all of it. The course
introduces students to a number of design processes and artifacts useful
for conception, documentation, collaboration and debugging.

Students are welcome to bring their interests and goals to the course
so that it is packed with fun and learning.

As Raph Koster put it, "Fun is just another word for learning".
